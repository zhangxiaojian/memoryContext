step one:
	cd ./mctx

step two:
	cmake ./

step three:
	make

step four:
	make install

Then the memory context lib is in ./mctx/lib/ . To use this lib, user's program need include file mctx.h
which is installed in ./mctx/include/

My test code is in ./mctx/src/tools/, after installation, the executable file mctx is installed in ./mctx/
